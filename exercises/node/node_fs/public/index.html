              HyperText Markup Language, or HTML, is the official language of
              the World Wide Web and was first widely introduced in 1990. HTML
              was originally created to allow those who were not specialized in
              SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) to publish and
              exchange scientific and other technical documents. HTML especially
              facilitated this exchange by incorporating the ability to link
              documents electronically using hyperlinks. Hypertext documents are
              interconnected by hyperlinks, which are typically activated by a
              mouse click, keypress, or by touching the screen. The first
              publicly available description of HTML was a document called “HTML
              Tags”, first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late
              1991. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively
              simple design of HTML.
