# Review 4/26/22 - Express.js

## What is it?

A web application framework built on Node

Can be used to build API endpoints

## How can we use it?

1. Install it `npm install express`
2. Import into a file
   - `const express = require("express")`
   - `import express from "express"`
3. Call `express()`, which returns an Express Application/Server Instance
4. Build routes with methods such as
   - `app.get()`
   - `app.post()`
   - `app.put()`
   - `app.delete()`
5. Each route receives a string url endpoint to match, and a callback function (request handler) to handle each route request
   - Each request handler is considered _middleware_, which is any function that intercepts the request/response cycle
   - Any _middleware_ is given the request (object), response (object), and next (callback) parameters
6. Call the `app.listen()` method to set your express app to listen on a specified port

## More Response Methods

- `sendFile` - receives an absolute filepath to the file to be read and sent back to the client
- `send` - receives data to send back; automatically sets the content type
- `json` - receives json data to send back; will stringify the json body and set the content type
- `redirect` - receives a new route path to redirect to
- `download` - receives an absolute filepath to the file that will be prompted to download on the client
