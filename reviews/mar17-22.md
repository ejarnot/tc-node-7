# Review 3/17/22 - HTML Intro

## Document Structure

- Include a `<!DOCTYPE html>` self-closed tag to start
  - explicitly defines the render document type as html
- `<html>` is the root element that encompasses all other elements
- Head
  - metadata, content that _describes_ the page
- Body
  - content that is _displayed_ to the user

## Elements

- Block Level elements take up the full available line width
- Inline Level elements only take up as much space as their containing content

## Relationship

HTML elements can contain other elements, creating a parent/child relationship

```html
<parent>
  <child></child>
  <child></child>
  <!-- ... -->
</parent>
```

## Containers

- Generic container
  - `<div>`
- Semantic Containers
  - `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<aside>`
- Text Container
  - `<span>`

## Forms

Forms take user input

- `<form>`
- `<input>`

## Headings

- h1 through h6
- Only one h1 per page
- Headers should be structured in number order h2 follows h1, h4 follows h3, etc

## Text

- `<p>` element with text content between opening and closing tags

## Attributes

- Add additional characteristics/functionality to elements
- name/value pairs written in the opening tag as `name="value"`

Examples:

```html
<a href="https://somelink.com">Some Link</a>

<img src="./path/to/image.png" alt="This describes the image with text" />
```
