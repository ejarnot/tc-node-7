            <P>
            <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>, or HTML, is the official language of the World Wide Web and was first widely introduced in 1990. HTML was originally created to allow those who were not specialized in SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) to publish and exchange scientific and other technical documents. HTML especially facilitated this exchange by incorporating the ability to link documents electronically using <em>hyperlinks</em>. Hypertext documents are interconnected by hyperlinks, which are typically activated by a mouse click, keypress, or by touching the screen. The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called “HTML Tags”, first mentioned on the Internet by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> in late 1991. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML.

             So what is a markup language anyways? In computer text processing, a markup language is a system for annotating a document noticeably different from the text. When the document is processed for display, the markup language is not shown, and is only used to format the text. The following is an example of the classic "Hello World" program:
            </p>
        </div>  
    <!-- closing body tag-->    
    </body>

    <!--closing html tag-->
</html>
